[Intro]
Sow melons, reap melons; sow beans, reap beans
Isn't this karma?
Karma is science;
It absolutely exists
(Yep, what up, Jack?)
Lan Lao

[Chorus]
God blesses with golden mountains and silver roads ahead
God advises not to meddle in the rivers and lakes of strife
God reminds me to hold onto goodness this lifetime
God fears the thirty-six strikes that thunder in the fall (Yeah, ayy)
Specters and demons always emerge after harvest time (Settle scores)
Specters and demons always emerge after harvest time (Eradicate)
God grants me a staff to strike down all vermin (Destiny)
With the second strike, I break through the enemy's walls (Huh)
Karma
Karma
(God says to lay down the blade, but that's up to Him, ayy)
Karma
Karma
(Should I lay down the blade, ayy?)

[Verse]
If I let go
Starving ghosts lurking in corners would strike in an instant (Hit)
If I dwell
Evil in my heart outweighs good; there’s no way to balance it
Debts must be repaid
Enemies come, I'll face them—I am a Nephalem
On my wrist
Five wealth deities guard the void, blocking everything (Ha)
The sea stirs mighty waves
Should we settle scores after autumn?
I am not God (Ayy)
I need to balance yin and yang
To comprehend karma and past deeds
(Understand karma and past deeds; Lan Lao)
Rules and boundaries in this world
Are like playing cards and keeping scores (Exactly)
It'll all catch up to you someday;
Who wouldn't want a comeback victory?
(Who wouldn't want a comeback victory, ayy?)
Some people are always selling misery
(Some people exploit kindness)
Unaware, God sees everything
The root of disaster will come knocking (Pathetic, ha)
You play with love as if it's a game
You turn love into bullets
Unaware, God sees everything
Clap your hands—game over (Lan Lao)
[Chorus]
God blesses with golden mountains and silver roads ahead
God advises not to meddle in the rivers and lakes of strife
God reminds me to hold onto goodness this lifetime
God fears the thirty-six strikes that thunder in the fall (Yeah, ayy)
Specters and demons always emerge after harvest time (Settle scores)
Specters and demons always emerge after harvest time (Eradicate)
God grants me a staff to strike down all vermin (Destiny)
With the second strike, I break through the enemy's walls (Huh)
Karma
Karma
(God says to lay down the blade, but that's up to Him, ayy)
Karma
Karma
(Fine, I'll give you some face)
